# Gravitask

**Get all the cubes within the given time limit!**

This project was my submission for the task given to me by Parody Studios in response to my Internship application.

The task was to create a game that met the following requirements:

1. Character Movement:
    Implement character movement using the W, A, S, and D keys.
    Implement jumping functionality using the Space key.

2. Gravity Manipulation:
    Implement gravity manipulation using arrow keys.
    Show a hologram of the character's reference direction when arrow keys are pressed.
    When the Enter key is pressed, manipulate the gravity in the selected direction.
    
3. Camera Setup:
    Implement a third-person camera setup for the game.

4. Animations:
    Properly implement character animations provided in the base project.

5. Timer:
    Display a timer on the screen with a limit of 2 minutes.
    If the player fails to collect all the cubes within the time limit, the game should be over.

6. Game Over Conditions:
    If the player falls freely (no contact with any surface), the game should be over.

7. Code Quality:
    Write well-structured, clean, and optimized code.
    Use proper code documentation and follow coding best practices.

8. Git Repository:
    Share the complete project on Git by creating a repository.
    Commit code changes regularly with meaningful commit messages.

9. Standalone Builds:
    Generate standalone builds of the game for both Windows and Mac platforms.
    Ensure that the builds are functional and can be executed without additional dependencies.


Apart from gravity manipulation, i was able to deliver on every other aspect of the game. I had a lot of fun doing this project because it pushed me out of my comfort zone

## Thank You!
